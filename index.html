		<h2>Come visit Christine's hometown, Ridgefield.</h2>
		<p>Located about 15 minutes north of Portland, OR, Ridgefield is a rapidly growing little city on the Columbia River. The city's high school, Ridgefield High School, has one claim to fame: its mascot, the Spudder. The Spuds made it big when David Letterman featured the Spudder on his Top Ten List for 'Worst High School Mascots' (which proves its coolness). The Spudder was inducted into ESPN's Mascot Hall of Fame in 1995.</p>
        <p>
        Ridgefield is also well-known as being the birthplace of the rental truck company UHAUL (there is a sign comemorating this historic event near the city center), and holds the Guiness world record for heaviest ginseng root (0.92 kilograms).
